* Course Description
  
*This syllabus is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor*

Students will work through  individual or team projects applying course-work
to the full data life cycle within a particular domain. Focus will also be
on best software engineering practices and reproducible research.
** syllabus
- Students have to present 10 minutes progress every week on Thursday in class as per assigned/agreed work in the project.

- Go over Python  for data science topics in each class for 30-60 minutes. Student will choose a topics in data science and present it with the help of python notebook to fellow students.
*See below for some tentative  topics.*


- Answer/help students on their project

- Go over some some topics as per students demands
